Characteristics: large (5-10cm), well-encapsulated, solid and cystic areas (hemorrhage, necrosis), low malignant potential (10-15% metastasize - liver, peritoneum). Location: any part of pancreas (tail common). Imaging: well-defined, heterogeneous (solid/cystic). Treatment: complete surgical resection - excellent prognosis (>95% cure). Reference: Papavramidis T.

'B', 'Ampullary carcinoma: arises from ampulla of Vater. Better prognosis than pancreatic adenocarcinoma because: (1) Earlier presentation (obstructive jaundice with small tumor), (2) Higher resectability (80-90%), (3) 5-year survival 30-50% (vs 10-20% for pancreatic). Types: intestinal (better prognosis) vs pancreatobiliary (worse - behaves like pancreatic/biliary). Treatment: Whipple procedure. May present with bleeding, anemia. Reference: Howe JR. Ann Surg. 1998.',
