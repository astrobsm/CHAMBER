CT shows splenic laceration, liver laceration, and pelvic fracture. Massive transfusion protocol is activated. After 6 units PRBCs, 4 FFP, 1 platelet pool, BP drops again to 75/45. What is the priority?',

'B',
'Damage control resuscitation: Patient in hemorrhagic shock with multiple bleeding sources, non-responder to resuscitation = ongoing hemorrhage. Principles: Permissive hypotension (target SBP 80-90), hemostatic resuscitation (1:1:1 ratio), damage control surgery (control bleeding, pack, temporary closure), correct lethal triad (hypothermia, acidosis, coagulopathy).

'Proceed to surgery without intervention',
'Delay surgery indefinitely',
'Oral iron only regardless of results',
'B',
'Preoperative anemia management: 1) Iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation). 2) If iron deficient: IV iron (ferric carboxymaltose - single dose corrects most deficiency, faster than oral). 3) Consider EPO if iron-replete but poor response. 4) Transfuse only if symptomatic, very low Hb, or time constraints. Evidence shows preoperative optimization reduces transfusion, improves outcomes. 3 weeks is adequate for IV iron response.',

'Citrate toxicity from blood products - give IV calcium gluconate or chloride, monitor ionized calcium',
'No treatment needed',

'Citrate toxicity: Blood products contain citrate anticoagulant. Citrate chelates calcium. With massive transfusion (greater than 10 units), liver cannot metabolize citrate fast enough, causing hypocalcemia. Symptoms: tingling, muscle cramps, QT prolongation, cardiac dysfunction. Treatment: Calcium gluconate 10ml IV or calcium chloride (more calcium per ml but vesicant). Monitor ionized calcium, give more if needed.',

'Cell salvage can keep up with any blood loss',
'Stop all transfusion',
'Only crystalloid resuscitation',
'B',
'Cell salvage limitations: Cannot process blood faster than it is lost in massive hemorrhage. Maximum processing rate typically 200-300ml/min. In catastrophic bleeding, cell salvage is adjunct, not replacement for banked blood. Continue cell salvage while giving allogeneic blood. Massive transfusion protocol provides blood faster than cell salvage can process. Use all available blood conservation measures.',

'Tissue appearance is irrelevant',
'Local wound care only',
'Above-knee is always required in diabetics',
'B',
'Amputation level selection: Must have adequate blood supply for healing. Signs of poor viability: edema, poor capillary refill, absent pulses, low transcutaneous oxygen (TcPO2 less than 30 mmHg). Options: More proximal amputation (through-knee or above-knee), vascular optimization (revascularization if possible before amputation), optimize diabetes and nutrition.

'Laparoscopic only',
'Avoid surgery entirely',
'Random entry point',
'B',
'Hostile abdomen approach: Multiple previous surgeries = dense adhesions, high enterotomy risk entering through old scar. Strategies: Enter through virgin territory if possible (lateral to previous incisions), use periumbilical entry (often less adherent), optical trocar entry for laparoscopy, stay close to anterior wall during adhesiolysis.

Options: Extended right subcostal (hockey stick), bilateral subcostal (Mercedes-Benz), right subcostal with upper midline (inverted Y). May need patient positioning (left lateral decubitus). Liver mobilization (dividing ligaments) also improves access.',
