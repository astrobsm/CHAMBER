'A patient with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis requires emergency surgery. Their last dialysis was 2 days ago. K+ is 6.5 mEq/L. What is the perioperative management?',
'Proceed to surgery immediately',
'Emergency preoperative dialysis to correct hyperkalemia, optimize fluid status; plan post-operative dialysis within 24 hours',
'Dialysis not possible before emergency surgery',
'K+ of 6.5 is acceptable',
'Surgery contraindicated in ESRD',
'B',
'ESRD emergency surgery: Preoperative considerations - hyperkalemia (temporize with medical therapy, may need emergent dialysis if severe), fluid overload, uremic platelet dysfunction, metabolic acidosis. Hyperkalemia 6.5+ with ECG changes requires urgent management. Post-operative dialysis usually within 24h. Avoid nephrotoxic drugs. Consider regional anesthesia (fluid sparing). Arm with AV fistula - no BP cuff or IV.',

'A patient on high-dose immunosuppression for organ transplant develops acute abdomen. CT suggests acute appendicitis. What are the special considerations?',
'Treat non-operatively',
'Atypical presentations common due to blunted inflammatory response; lower threshold for surgical intervention; infection risk higher post-operatively',
'No modifications to care',
'Immunosuppression protects against surgical complications',
'Surgery contraindicated in transplant patients',
'B',
'Immunosuppressed patient surgery: Blunted inflammatory response - may mask peritonitis (less fever, less tenderness, lower WBC). Lower threshold for imaging and intervention. Post-operative: Higher infection risk, poor wound healing, stress dose steroids if on chronic steroids. Do not reduce immunosuppression without transplant team input. Antibiotic coverage broader. May need ICU monitoring.',

'A pregnant woman at 26 weeks gestation develops acute appendicitis. What are the surgical approach considerations?',
'Delay surgery until after delivery',
'Surgery indicated - risk of perforation outweighs surgical risk; laparoscopic approach acceptable with modifications; involve obstetrics for fetal monitoring',
'Medical management only',
'Open surgery always required',
'Appendicitis does not occur in pregnancy',
'B',
'Appendicitis in pregnancy: Most common non-obstetric surgical emergency. Risks: Perforation (higher in pregnancy due to delayed diagnosis), preterm labor, fetal loss. Surgery indicated - perforation has worse outcomes than surgery. Laparoscopy acceptable (modifications: left lateral tilt, adjust trocar positions for gravid uterus, lower insufflation pressures). Obstetrics involvement for fetal monitoring. Can operate at any trimester.',

'Dopamine as third agent',
'Phenylephrine only',
'No further options available',
'B',
'Refractory septic shock: After norepinephrine + vasopressin, consider: 1) Adrenaline (epinephrine) - vasoconstrictor + inotrope, useful if cardiac dysfunction (septic cardiomyopathy). 2) Dobutamine - if cardiac dysfunction without need for more vasoconstriction. 3) Low-dose steroids (hydrocortisone) if not already started. 4) Reassess source control. Consider echo for cardiac function assessment.',

'Avoid all vasopressors',
'General anesthesia contraindicated',
'Defer surgery regardless of indication',
'B',
'Surgery in cardiogenic shock: High-risk setting. Considerations: Invasive monitoring (arterial line, CVP, may need PA catheter or echo), careful induction (avoid hypotension - ketamine/etomidate preferred), may need pre-induction inotropes/vasopressors, minimize surgical time, have inotropes ready, consider IABP if available. Goal: Maintain coronary perfusion pressure. Balance need for surgery against cardiac risk.',

'B',
'Central diabetes insipidus (CDI): Post-pituitary surgery or head injury. Features: Polyuria (greater than 3L/day or greater than 200ml/h), dilute urine (Osm less than 300), hypernatremia, increased serum osmolality. Diagnosis: Clinical + urine specific gravity less than 1.005. Treatment: DDAVP (desmopressin) - nasal or IV. Free water replacement for hypernatremia.

'A patient undergoing liver transplantation develops diffuse microvascular bleeding despite normal platelet count. TEG/ROTEM shows prolonged R-time (clot initiation) and normal clot strength. What is the management?',
'Platelet transfusion',
'FFP or PCC to replace clotting factors - prolonged R-time indicates factor deficiency while clot strength is maintained',
'Cryoprecipitate only',
'Surgical hemostasis only',
'Red cell transfusion',
'B',
'TEG/ROTEM guided transfusion: R-time/CT = clot initiation (clotting factors). K-time/CFT = clot kinetics. MA/MCF = clot strength (platelets/fibrinogen). Prolonged R-time with normal clot strength = factor deficiency (needs FFP/PCC). Low clot strength = need fibrinogen (cryoprecipitate) or platelets. Goal-directed transfusion based on viscoelastic testing reduces overall transfusion and improves outcomes.',

'A patient with chronic liver disease has INR 2.0 and needs a liver biopsy. Is correction with FFP appropriate?',
'Always correct INR before any procedure',
'Standard INR/PT not reliable in liver disease - these patients often have balanced coagulopathy; FFP may not help and has risks; consider viscoelastic testing if available',
'FFP always corrects liver coagulopathy',
'Never give FFP in liver disease',
'Vitamin K corrects liver coagulopathy',
'B',
'Coagulation in liver disease: Liver produces both procoagulant (factors) AND anticoagulant (protein C, S, antithrombin) factors. In cirrhosis, both reduced = "rebalanced" hemostasis. INR reflects procoagulant factors only, not true bleeding risk. Platelet count and function may be more relevant. FFP may not improve hemostasis and has volume/TRALI risk. TEG/ROTEM better reflects true coagulation status.',

'Consider debridement, advanced wound therapies (NPWT, bioengineered skin substitutes, hyperbaric oxygen), ensure vascular status optimized',
'No options remain',
'Amputation is only option now',
'Stop all treatment',
'B',
'Chronic wound stalled in inflammatory phase: Normal healing progresses through phases. Chronic wounds often stuck in inflammation (cytokine imbalance, MMPs elevated). Interventions: Sharp debridement (removes senescent cells, restarts healing cascade), NPWT, growth factors (becaplermin), bioengineered skin substitutes, hyperbaric oxygen (increases tissue oxygenation, angiogenesis). Ensure systemic factors optimized (glucose, nutrition, vascular supply).',

'Antibiotics only',
'Skin grafting',
'Leave untreated',
'B',
'Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG): Neutrophilic dermatosis, often associated with IBD, arthritis, hematologic malignancy. Pathergy - trauma (including surgery) triggers/worsens lesions. Features: Rapid ulceration, violaceous undermined edges, severe pain, sterile pustules. Management: Avoid surgical debridement (pathergy), immunosuppression (high-dose steroids first line, cyclosporine, infliximab), topical therapies, supportive wound care.

'Only clips possible laparoscopically',
'Energy devices contraindicated laparoscopically',
'No hemostasis possible',
'B',
'Laparoscopic hemostasis options: 1) Monopolar diathermy - current through tissue to patient plate. 2) Bipolar - current between forceps tips only (safer near vital structures). 3) Ultrasonic (Harmonic) - mechanical vibration creates heat, coagulates. 4) Vessel sealing (LigaSure) - controlled pressure + bipolar energy. 5) Clips - mechanical occlusion. 6) Sutures - intracorporeal or extracorporeal. 7) Topical agents (Surgicel, Floseal).',

'A surgeon is repairing a ventral hernia and has a choice of mesh placement: onlay, sublay, or underlay. Which position is associated with lowest recurrence?',
'Onlay (superficial to fascia)',
'Sublay (retromuscular/preperitoneal) - protected position, good tissue incorporation, lower recurrence than onlay',
'Inlay (bridging defect)',
'All positions equivalent',
'Mesh not used for ventral hernias',
'B',
'Mesh position for ventral hernia: Sublay (retromuscular/preperitoneal) has lowest recurrence rates. Benefits: Mesh protected by muscle, Pascal principle (pressure distributes mesh against abdominal wall), good tissue incorporation, lower infection and mesh exposure rates. Onlay: Higher recurrence, seroma, infection. Underlay/IPOM: Requires anti-adhesive mesh (intraperitoneal placement). Inlay (bridging): Not recommended.',

'A patient with tibial fracture develops delayed union at 4 months. X-ray shows sclerotic bone ends with persistent fracture line but no gap. What intervention may promote healing?',
'Continue observation indefinitely',
'Consider dynamization of nail, bone grafting, or exchange nailing - sclerotic ends suggest atrophic non-union developing',
'Immediate amputation',
'Remove all fixation',
'Cast immobilization only',
'B',
'Delayed union/non-union management: Delayed union = slower than expected healing but still progressing. Non-union = healing stopped. Hypertrophic non-union (reactive bone ends) = needs stability (dynamization, exchange nail). Atrophic non-union (sclerotic ends, no reaction) = needs biology (bone graft, BMP) plus stability. Options: Dynamization (remove locking screws), exchange nailing (reams canal, adds biology), bone graft, plating.',

'Standard plating techniques',
'Locking plates (fixed-angle construct), longer plates with more screws, bicortical purchase, augmentation with cement or bone substitute, bridge plating',
'External fixation only',
'Avoid all internal fixation in osteoporosis',
'Standard screws adequate',
'B',
'Osteoporotic fracture fixation: Challenges - poor screw purchase, bone failure before implant failure. Solutions: 1) Locking plates (screws lock into plate creating fixed-angle construct, load sharing). 2) Longer plates, more screws (distribute load). 3) Cement augmentation (polymethylmethacrylate improves purchase). 4) Bridge plating (biological technique, preserves blood supply). 5) Calcium phosphate bone substitutes. 6) Consider arthroplasty for periarticular fractures.',

'Consider internal cardiac massage (direct compression of heart through laparotomy) - more effective than external CPR in open abdomen situation',
'CPR not possible with open abdomen',
'Only defibrillation, no compressions',
'Close abdomen before CPR',
'B',
'Intraoperative cardiac arrest: Unique situation with direct access. Internal cardiac massage (hands around heart through laparotomy/thoracotomy) more effective than external CPR (no chest wall in the way). Technique: One or two hands around ventricles, compress against sternum or other hand. Rate 100-120/min. Address surgical cause (bleeding, CO2 embolus, tension pneumothorax). Standard drug doses.

'Refractory to defibrillation until K+ lowered - prioritize IV calcium, insulin/dextrose, bicarbonate, dialysis if available alongside ACLS',
'Hyperkalemia is irrelevant in arrest',
'Only external pacing works',
'Never survivable',
'B',
'Hyperkalemia cardiac arrest: K+ greater than 7-8 mEq/L can cause VF/asystole that is refractory to standard ACLS. Mechanism: K+ depolarizes membrane, interferes with cardiac conduction. Treatment during CPR: IV calcium gluconate 30ml (or calcium chloride 10ml), insulin 10U + dextrose 25g, sodium bicarbonate 50-100mEq, consider dialysis if immediately available. K+ must be lowered for defibrillation to be effective.',

'A patient in septic shock has ScvO2 (central venous oxygen saturation) of 45%. What does this indicate and what is the target?',
'Normal ScvO2',
'Low ScvO2 indicates inadequate oxygen delivery relative to demand - target greater than 70%; may need fluid resuscitation, transfusion, or inotropes',
'High oxygen delivery',
'Indicates hyperoxia',
'ScvO2 is irrelevant in sepsis',
'B',
'ScvO2 interpretation: Normal 65-75%. Low ScvO2 (less than 65%) = tissues extracting more oxygen (increased demand or decreased delivery). Causes: Hypovolemia, anemia, low cardiac output, high metabolic demand. Management to increase ScvO2: Fluids, blood transfusion (if Hb low), inotropes (if cardiac output low), reduce demand (sedation, fever control). Target ScvO2 greater than 70% in early sepsis resuscitation (though recent trials question this target).',

'CO2 gas embolism - gas entry into venous system; release pneumoperitoneum, left lateral head down position, 100% O2, CPR if arrest',
'Tube displacement',
'Normal variation',
'Improved ventilation',
'B',
'CO2 embolism during laparoscopy: Gas enters venous system through open vessels. Features: Sudden ETCO2 drop (gas blocks pulmonary circulation), hypotension, mill-wheel murmur, cardiovascular collapse. Management: Immediately release pneumoperitoneum (deflate abdomen), left lateral head down position (trap gas in RA), 100% O2, IV fluids, CPR if arrest. Rare but potentially fatal.
