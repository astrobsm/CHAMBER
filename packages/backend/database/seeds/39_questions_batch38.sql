'Why is the gridiron (McBurney) incision considered "muscle-splitting" rather than "muscle-cutting"?',
'Because no muscles are in this area',
'Muscles (external oblique, internal oblique, transversus) are split along their fiber direction, not cut across, preserving innervation',
'Only fascia is split',
'Muscles regenerate immediately',
'It is the same as muscle-cutting',
