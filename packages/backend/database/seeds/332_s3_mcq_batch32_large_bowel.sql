'B', 'Toxic megacolon management: (1) Medical: bowel rest, IV fluids, NG tube (decompress proximal GI), electrolyte correction, avoid opioids/anticholinergics (worsen dilatation), broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids if IBD (not if infection). (2) Close monitoring: serial exams, X-rays. (3) Surgery if: perforation, peritonitis, massive hemorrhage, no improvement 24-72 hours, progressive dilatation, worsening toxicity. Surgery: subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy. Mortality without perforation 4%, with perforation 40-50%. Reference: Sheth SG. Gastroenterol Clin North Am. 1998.',
