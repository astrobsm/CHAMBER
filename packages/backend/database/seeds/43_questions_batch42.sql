'A pregnant woman at 32 weeks gestation collapses and is found to be in cardiac arrest. CPR is initiated. What modification to standard ACLS is required?',
'No modifications needed',
'Manual left uterine displacement during CPR to relieve aortocaval compression, early consideration of perimortem cesarean section if no ROSC',
'Only chest compressions needed',
'Lower energy shocks',
'Delayed defibrillation',
'B',
'Pregnant cardiac arrest modifications: 1) Manual left uterine displacement (15-30 degrees) - relieves IVC compression, improves venous return. 2) CPR above the lower sternum (fundus elevates diaphragm). 3) Perimortem cesarean within 4-5 minutes if no ROSC - improves maternal hemodynamics and fetal survival. 4) Same drug doses and defibrillation energy. Early intubation for aspiration risk.',

'During CPR, end-tidal CO2 monitoring shows a reading of 8 mmHg despite good quality compressions for 20 minutes. What does this indicate?',
'Normal CPR progress',
'Poor prognosis - persistently low ETCO2 (less than 10) during CPR suggests poor cardiac output and unlikely ROSC',
'CPR quality is adequate',
'Patient is improving',
'Continue indefinitely',
'B',
'ETCO2 during CPR: Reflects pulmonary blood flow and thus cardiac output generated by compressions. ETCO2 less than 10 mmHg after 20 minutes of CPR suggests poor prognosis. Sudden rise in ETCO2 (greater than 40) suggests ROSC. ETCO2 can also guide CPR quality - low readings may indicate need to optimize compressions. Prognostic value helps guide termination decisions.',

Lactate is more sensitive marker than vital signs for shock. Management: Aggressive resuscitation, serial lactate monitoring (should decrease with adequate resuscitation), search for ongoing bleeding or injury. Failure to clear lactate = poor prognosis.',
