'Three most common trauma mechanisms',
'Hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy creating self-perpetuating cycle; managed with damage control surgery, aggressive warming, balanced transfusion, and physiologic resuscitation',
'Head, chest, abdomen injuries',
'Shock, infection, organ failure',
'Not a real concept',
'B',
'Trauma lethal triad: Components: Hypothermia → coagulopathy (cold impairs clotting enzymes), acidosis → coagulopathy (impairs factor function), coagulopathy → bleeding → acidosis and hypothermia. Cycle: Self-perpetuating, rapidly fatal. Management: Prevent/treat hypothermia (warm fluids, blankets, warm OR), damage control surgery (abbreviated operation), blood product resuscitation (balanced ratios), correct acidosis (restore perfusion).

'Rapidly identifies cardiac cause (tamponade, RV failure/PE, LV dysfunction), assesses volume status, and guides fluid vs vasopressor therapy',
'Only for cardiologists',
'Delays resuscitation',
'Replaced by CVP monitoring',
'B',
'Echo in shock: Point-of-care echo: Quickly identifies shock etiology. Findings: Tamponade (pericardial fluid with RV collapse), massive PE (RV dilation/dysfunction), LV failure (poor contractility), hypovolemia (hyperdynamic, small chambers). IVC: Collapsible suggests fluid responsive (in spontaneously breathing patients). Integration: Part of resuscitation, guides therapy selection. RUSH exam: Rapid Ultrasound in Shock - systematic approach. Skill: Requires training but increasingly standard.',

'Identical presentation',
'Distributive: warm extremities, bounding pulses, wide pulse pressure initially; hypovolemic: cool extremities, weak thready pulses, narrow pulse pressure',
'Only by lab testing',
'No clinical distinction',
'Blood pressure alone',
'B',
'Shock differentiation: Hypovolemic: ↓preload → ↓CO → compensatory vasoconstriction → cold extremities, weak pulses, narrow pulse pressure. Distributive (sepsis, anaphylaxis): Vasodilation → warm extremities, bounding pulses, wide pulse pressure (in hyperdynamic phase). Both: Tachycardia, hypotension (eventually), altered mental status. Importance: Different management - hypovolemic needs volume; distributive needs volume + vasopressors. Late distributive may look "cold" as compensation fails.',

'Excessive chloride causes hyperchloremic acidosis, may reduce renal perfusion and GFR, and is associated with worse outcomes in some studies',
'Chloride is always beneficial',
'Only affects sodium levels',
'Prevents hyponatremia',
'B',
'NS chloride load: 0.9% NS: 154 mEq/L chloride (plasma ~100 mEq/L). Large volume: ↑chloride → hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (non-anion gap). Renal effects: ↑chloride may cause renal vasoconstriction → ↓GFR. Clinical data: Some studies (SPLIT, SMART) suggest balanced solutions associated with better renal outcomes. Current trend: Favor balanced crystalloids (LR, Plasmalyte) over NS for most resuscitation. Exceptions: NS for hypochloremia, brain injury (lower osmolarity concern).',

'Hypokalemia and arrhythmias: Mechanism: Low extracellular K+ → more negative resting membrane potential → delayed repolarization. ECG changes: Flattened T waves, U waves, ST depression, QT prolongation (really QU). Arrhythmias: PVCs, VT, VF, torsades de pointes (especially with QT prolongation). Risk factors: Digoxin therapy, underlying heart disease, concurrent hypomagnesemia. Treatment: Correct K+ (and Mg), monitor ECG. Prevention: Adequate supplementation in at-risk patients.',

'B',
'TRALI vs TACO: TRALI: Non-cardiogenic (normal PCWP), immune-mediated (donor antibodies activate recipient neutrophils in lungs), hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates, often hypotension, no fluid overload, normal/low BNP, fever common. Treatment: Supportive (O2, ventilation). TACO: Cardiogenic (elevated PCWP), volume overload, hypertension, elevated BNP. Treatment: Diuresis. Differentiation: BNP, echo, fluid balance.

'All SSI treated the same',
'Only affects billing',
'Outdated classification',
'B',
'SSI classification (CDC): Superficial incisional: Skin and subcutaneous only, within 30 days. Treatment: Open and drain, no antibiotics if no cellulitis. Deep incisional: Fascia/muscle, within 30 days (or 90 days with implant). Treatment: May need OR for debridement. Organ/Space: Any body area opened/manipulated, within 30 days (90 with implant).

'FTSG always preferred',
'STSG only for burns',
'No difference in outcomes',
'B',
'STSG vs FTSG: STSG: Epidermis + partial dermis. Advantages: Takes on less vascular beds, donor heals spontaneously (can reharvest), larger areas covered. Disadvantages: More contraction, less durable, poorer cosmesis. FTSG: Epidermis + full dermis. Advantages: Less contraction (maintains more dermal elements), better cosmesis, more durable. Disadvantages: Needs well-vascularized bed, donor site requires closure (limits size), higher failure rate. Choice: Based on recipient site quality, cosmetic needs, defect size.',

'What is the rationale for using running versus interrupted sutures for fascial closure?',
'No difference',
'Running: Faster, distributes tension evenly, uses less suture; interrupted: More secure at each point, localized failure does not compromise entire closure; evidence shows similar outcomes',
'Running always better',
'Interrupted never used',
'Only for skin closure',
'B',
'Running vs interrupted fascia closure: Running: Faster, distributes tension along entire length, economic (less suture). Potential: Single point failure can propagate. Interrupted: Each suture independent, localized failure limited. More time-consuming, more suture material. Evidence: Large trials (STITCH, PRIMA) show similar outcomes with proper technique. Technique matters: Small bites (5mm), close intervals (5mm) may reduce hernia with running closure. Surgeon preference often determines choice.',

'Only cosmetic consideration',
'Muscle always regenerates',
'No difference in strength',
'B',
'Rectus muscle and incisions: Anatomy: Rectus muscle major contributor to abdominal wall strength. Midline incision: Through linea alba, muscle not divided. Paramedian: Through rectus sheath, muscle retracted (not divided). Muscle-cutting transverse: Divides rectus, may weaken wall. Subcostal (Kocher): Divides rectus. Impact: Preserving muscle integrity theoretically reduces hernia risk. Modern practice: Midline most common for exploration, minimally invasive when possible, muscle-sparing approaches when feasible.',

'CT scan same day',
'MRI always required',
'No treatment needed',
'B',
'Occult scaphoid fracture: Problem: Initial x-rays miss up to 20% of scaphoid fractures; bone appears normal until resorption at fracture site. Clinical suspicion: Anatomic snuffbox tenderness, scaphoid tubercle tenderness, pain with axial thumb compression. Management: Thumb spica immobilization, repeat x-ray in 10-14 days (fracture becomes visible). Alternative: Early MRI or CT if early diagnosis critical (high-level athlete, return to work). Importance: Missed scaphoid fracture → non-union, avascular necrosis.',

'No compression ever',
'Full compression regardless',
'Arterial surgery mandatory first',
'B',
'Mixed ulcer management: Definition: Both arterial and venous disease contributing. Assessment: ABPI determines approach. ABPI 0.5-0.8: Modified/reduced compression (23-30 mmHg instead of 35-40), monitor for ischemic symptoms. ABPI <0.5: Avoid compression, vascular intervention may be needed first. Treatment: Address both components. If severe PAD: Revascularization before ulcer can heal. Multidisciplinary approach often needed. Goal: Improve arterial supply while managing venous component.',

'Indwelling always required',
'Medication only',
'Diapers for all patients',
'B',
'Catheter alternatives: Intermittent: Gold standard for neurogenic bladder - lower UTI rate, better bladder health. Frequency: 4-6 times daily. Suprapubic: Better for long-term catheterization - lower urethral complications. External (condom catheter): For male incontinence, does not drain bladder (no retention option). Bladder training: For appropriate patients post-operatively. Key principle: Choose least invasive option that meets clinical need; remove/discontinue as soon as possible; intermittent preferred over indwelling when feasible.',
