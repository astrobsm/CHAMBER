'CO2 embolism - gas enters venous circulation creating air lock; immediate management includes deflating abdomen, left lateral decubitus position, supportive care',
'Anaphylaxis',
'Malignant hyperthermia',
'Pneumothorax',
'B',
'CO2 embolism: Rare but life-threatening laparoscopic complication. Mechanism: Gas enters open vein (during liver surgery, venous injury). Symptoms: Sudden ↓ETCO2 (gas blocks pulmonary flow), cardiovascular collapse, JVD (right heart outflow obstruction), "mill wheel" murmur. Management: Stop insufflation, deflate abdomen, 100% O2, left lateral head-down position (traps gas in RV apex), cardiovascular support, consider aspiration through central line. Prevention: Low insufflation pressure, recognize venous injury.',

'A patient with massive GI bleeding is resuscitated with crystalloid. Despite adequate volume, lactate remains elevated. What explains persistent lactic acidosis?',
'Lactate always elevated in GI bleeding',
'Anaerobic metabolism continues during resuscitation with crystalloid because RBCs (oxygen-carrying capacity) were lost, not just volume',
'Liver metabolizes lactate faster',
'Crystalloid contains lactate',
'No clinical significance',
'B',
'Crystalloid vs blood resuscitation: Hemorrhage loses RBCs (oxygen carriers) + plasma. Crystalloid replaces volume but NOT oxygen-carrying capacity. Result: Despite adequate BP, tissue hypoxia continues → persistent lactate. Point: In hemorrhagic shock, blood products restore oxygen delivery, not just volume. Massive transfusion protocols address this. Lactate clearance requires adequate oxygen delivery, which requires adequate hemoglobin, not just volume.',

('b0000003-0000-0000-0000-000000000003', 'a0000001-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
'What is the difference between fluid responsive and fluid non-responsive shock?',
'No clinical difference',
'Fluid responsive patients increase cardiac output with volume challenge; non-responsive patients need vasopressors/inotropes rather than more fluids',
'All shock is fluid responsive',
'Non-responsive means dying',
'Determined by blood type',
'B',
'Fluid responsiveness: Concept: Will the patient''s cardiac output improve with fluid bolus? Responsive: Preload-dependent (e.g., early hypovolemia) - giving fluid increases CO. Non-responsive: Either adequate preload already OR cardiac limitation - more fluid doesn''t help, may cause pulmonary edema. Assessment: Dynamic measures (pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation, leg raise test). Importance: Guides therapy - fluid if responsive, vasopressors/inotropes if not.',

'Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (hyperchloremic) with hypokalemia from GI bicarbonate losses',
'Respiratory acidosis',
'Respiratory alkalosis',
'No acid-base disturbance',
'B',
'Diarrhea electrolyte disturbance: Diarrhea loses bicarbonate-rich fluid. Result: Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (AG = 142 - 115 - 14 = 13, normal). Chloride increases to maintain electroneutrality → hyperchloremic. Also loses K+ → hypokalemia. Hypokalemia makes acidosis worse (K+ shifts out of cells, H+ shifts in, kidney excretes less H+). Treatment: Replace volume, bicarbonate (cautiously), potassium. Treat underlying cause of diarrhea.',

'Hyperkalemia',
'Seizures from high sodium',
'No danger exists',
'B',
'Osmotic demyelination syndrome: Chronic hyponatremia: Brain adapts by losing organic osmolytes (days). If corrected too quickly: Extracellular osmolality rises → water shifts out of brain cells → cellular shrinkage and demyelination, especially in pons. Symptoms: Delayed (2-6 days) - dysarthria, dysphagia, quadriparesis, locked-in syndrome. Often irreversible. Prevention: Limit correction to 10-12 mEq/L in 24 hours, 18 mEq/L in 48 hours. Higher risk: Alcoholism, malnutrition, hypokalemia.',

'Irradiated blood products: Purpose: Gamma radiation damages donor T-lymphocytes, preventing proliferation. Prevents: Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). TA-GVHD: Donor lymphocytes attack host tissues - almost always fatal. Indications: Immunocompromised patients (bone marrow transplant, congenital immunodeficiency, lymphoma), intrauterine transfusion, transfusion from relatives, certain drugs.

'RBCs, plasma, and platelets in balanced ratios (1:1:1) during massive transfusion; prioritize RBCs for oxygen delivery but avoid neglecting coagulation support',
'Platelets first',
'Cryoprecipitate only',
'Order does not matter',
'B',
'Massive transfusion product ordering: Traditional sequential approach led to dilutional coagulopathy. Current practice: Balanced transfusion (1:1:1 or similar ratio of RBC:plasma:platelets). PROPPR trial: 1:1:1 improved hemostasis, trend toward better survival. Begin transfusion with RBCs for immediate oxygen delivery, but activate massive transfusion protocol early to have plasma and platelets available. Avoid crystalloid-heavy resuscitation. Goal: Prevent rather than treat coagulopathy.',

'Infection only',
'Sustained pressure exceeds capillary closing pressure (32 mmHg), causing tissue ischemia; duration and intensity of pressure both contribute to injury',
'Direct tissue trauma',
'Allergic reaction to bedding',
'Autoimmune destruction',
'B',
'Pressure ulcer pathophysiology: Normal capillary closing pressure approximately 32 mmHg. Sustained external pressure above this occludes capillaries → tissue ischemia → necrosis. Pressure + time = injury (high pressure shorter time, lower pressure longer time). Contributing factors: Shear (tissue layers sliding), friction (surface abrasion), moisture (maceration). At-risk tissues: Over bony prominences (sacrum, heels, ischium). Prevention: Frequent repositioning, pressure-redistributing surfaces, nutrition.',

'Random occurrence',
'No factors influence security',
'Gloves cause slipping',
'B',
'Knot security factors: Suture material: Monofilament (nylon, prolene, PDS) - smooth surface, more throws needed (5-6). Braided (vicryl, silk) - higher friction, fewer throws (3-4). Technique: Square knots (throws at right angles), not slip knots. Lay throws flat without crossing. Number of throws: More throws = more security (up to a point). Tension: Excessive tension during tying weakens suture. Air knots: Knots not seated properly slip. Memory: Monofilament tends to return to original shape.',

'Self-anchoring barbs eliminate need for knots; allow continuous running closure with even tension distribution and potentially faster closure time',
'Lower cost',
'Less tissue reaction',

'B',
'Barbed sutures: Design: Multiple barbs cut into suture allow unidirectional passage - tissue catches on barbs, preventing pull-through. Advantages: Knotless closure (no knot failure), continuous tension distribution, faster closure (no tying). Uses: Fascial closure, plastic surgery, orthopedic surgery, laparoscopic port closure. Considerations: Cannot be adjusted once placed, learning curve, cost. Not all wound types suitable. Emerging evidence supports efficacy.',

'No clinical significance',
'B',
'High NG output: Normal NG output decreases as ileus resolves. Persistently high output suggests: Prolonged ileus (infection? electrolyte abnormality?), mechanical obstruction (adhesion, anastomotic stricture), gastric outlet obstruction. Management: Continue NG decompression, keep NPO, investigate cause (CT if obstruction suspected), correct electrolytes, nutrition support if prolonged. Do not remove NG or advance diet until output decreasing and bowel function returning.',

'Same supply throughout muscle',
'B',
'Rectus abdominis blood supply: Superior epigastric artery (from internal mammary) and inferior epigastric artery (from external iliac) supply muscle. Watershed zone in periumbilical region. Significance: TRAM flap (breast reconstruction) based on these vessels. Subcostal incisions may damage superior epigastric. Paramidline incisions may compromise flap options. Lower transverse incisions (Pfannenstiel) preserve blood supply. Consider future reconstruction needs in incision planning.',

'Time of day',
'B',
'Incision selection factors: Vertical midline: Rapid entry, extensible, versatile exposure, best for emergency/unknown pathology. Transverse: Better cosmesis, may heal stronger (along Langer''s lines), specific exposure for certain procedures. Subcostal: Biliary, spleen, adrenal. Pfannenstiel: Pelvic procedures, cosmesis. Patient factors: Previous scars (use same incision usually), body habitus, planned reconstruction. Emergent surgery: Usually midline for versatility.',

Assessment: Identify reflux (>0.5 sec retrograde flow), map superficial and deep venous anatomy, detect DVT, assess perforator incompetence. Clinical utility: Guides treatment - superficial reflux amenable to ablation/surgery, deep reflux less treatable. EVRA trial: Early intervention on superficial reflux speeds healing.

Treatment: Endovascular stenting of iliac vein. Consider in: Left-sided venous disease, young patients, refractory to standard therapy.',
